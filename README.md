# MAITS-Website

[Morse Accounting and Income Tax Service Website](https://shawnmthompson.github.io/MAITS-Website/)

# README

This is a static website designed and developed by Shawn Thompson for Morse Accounting and Income Tax Service, a tax-office business based in Maine.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# USAGE

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the 'index.html' file in a web browser to view the website. Will require a live server extension or any other hosting solution of your choosing.

# REMAINING TASKS

- Re-work the HTML to make it more accesssible and responsive
- DRY the CSS (there appears to be a lot of redundant styling that either conflicts or has no effect, I genuinely don't know what was I doing lol).
- Consider adding a rotating element that swaps out the banner every ~5-10 seconds to showcase more of what the business has to offer.
