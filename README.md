# README:
This is a website designed and developed by Shawn Thompson for Morse Accounting and Income Tax Service, a tax-office business based in Maine. 
I was given permission to make a repository of the website by the business owner: Deanna Thompson.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

# Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

# NOTE:
I intend to continuously develop and expand on this website as I improve and as I learn more technologies that I can incorporate into my web development process (e.g. React, Tailwind, PHP). I intend for these three technologies to be implemented into this website by the end of Q3 2024.
