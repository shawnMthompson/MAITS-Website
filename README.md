# MAITS-Website:
Morse Accounting and Income Tax Service Website

# README:
This is a website designed and developed by Shawn Thompson for Morse Accounting and Income Tax Service, a tax-office business based in Maine. 
I was given permission to make a repository of the website by the business owner: Deanna Thompson.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED (2/16/2024):
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the 'index.html' file in a web browser to view the website.

# NOTE:
I intend to continuously develop this website as I improve and as I learn more technologies that I can incorporate into my web development process (e.g. React, Tailwind, etc). I intend for these two technologies to be implemented into this website by the start of Q3 2024, but we'll see where the wind takes me in that regard.
